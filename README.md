# User Guide
## part 2 - Cloth Simulation
Press 'r' to reset the scene.

Press 'm' to change render mode.
* mode 1 - render with cloth
* mode 2 - debug mode with string system

Press '=' to add air volocity to positive x-Axis. (The boundary of the velocity is fixed)

Press '-' to add air volocity to negative x-Axis. (The boundary of the velocity is fixed)

## part 3 - Continuum Fluid Simulation

Press 'r' to reset the water.

Mouse click on water surface to 'add drops' to water.
